;; Includes:
;; - 6.1 vsetvli/vsetivl/vsetvl instructions
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------

;; we dont't define vsetvli as unspec_volatile which has side effects.
;; This instruction can be scheduled by the instruction scheduler.
;; This means these instructions will be deleted when
;; there is no instructions using vl or vtype in the following.
;; rd  | rs1 | AVL value | Effect on vl
;; -   | !x0 | x[rs1]    | Normal stripmining
;; !x0 | x0  | ~0        | Set vl to VLMAX
;; operands[0] is VL.
;; operands[1] is AVL.
